# Optimum-Solver-for-TSP

Optimum Solver for Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) In Java

The goal of this project is to demonstrate Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with using optimum solver algorithm.

There is a text file which contains cities in the world. Every city has a name, latitude and longitude values. 
By reading these datas in our program, we are setting our starting position which is Istanbul. 
The purpose of the project is to start traveling from our starting position to first 'n' cities. 
Then we will go back to our starting position without revisiting any of our previous cities. 
We are calculating every possible total km result and comparing each of them and selecting the best one.
